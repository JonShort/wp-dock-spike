# wp-dock-spike
Spike to check out docker functionality with wordpress

## Installation

- `git clone` it somewhere
- Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- `cd /wp-dock-spike`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
- Wordpress should now be running at port 8080 usually accessed via [localhost](http://localhost:8080/) 

## Notes
This repo is mainly to get to grips with docker and wordpress within git. I followed [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/) to bootstrap the repo, with some tweaks to pull down the content locally.
